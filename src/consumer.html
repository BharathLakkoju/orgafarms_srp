            <p><span class="bold">The</span> term “organic” refers to how certain foods are produced. Organic foods have been grown or farmed without the use of:
            <h1>Artificial chemicals</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hormones</li>
                    <li>Antibiotics</li>
                    <li>Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)</li>
                </ul>
            <span class="bold">In</span> order to be labelled organic, a food product must be free of artificial food additives. This includes artificial
            sweeteners, preservatives, coloring, flavoring, and <span class="semi-bold">monosodium glutamate (MSG).</span>
            Organically grown crops tend to use natural fertilizers like manure to improve plant growth. Animals raised organically
            are not given antibiotics or hormones. Organic farming tends to improve soil quality and the conservation of
            groundwater. It also reduces pollution and may be better for the environment.
            The most commonly purchased organic foods are fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products and meat. Processed organic
            products are also available, such as sodas, cookies, and meat substitutes.</p>

            <h1 class="head">Benefits of taking organic food/why to use organic products:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="semi-bold">O</span>rganic produce contains fewer pesticides. Chemicals such as <span class="semi-bold">synthetic fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides</span> are
                    widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on (and in) the food we eat.</li><br>
                <li><span class="semi-bold">O</span>rganic food is often fresher because it doesn’t contain preservatives that make it last longer. Organic produce is
                    sometimes (but not always, so watch where it is from) produced on smaller farms nearer to where it is sold.</li><br>
                <li><span class="semi-bold">O</span>rganic farming tends to be better for the environment. Organic farming practices may <span class="semi-bold">reduce</span> pollution, conserve
                    water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without synthetic pesticides is
                    also
                    better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms.</li><br>
                <li><span class="semi-bold">O</span>rganically raised animals are <span class="semi-bold">NOT</span> given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts. Feeding livestock
                    animal byproducts increases the risk of <span class="semi-bold">Mad cow disease (BSE)</span> and the use of antibiotics can create
                    antibiotic-resistant
                    strains of bacteria. Organically-raised animals tend to be given more space to move around and access to the
                    outdoors,
                    which helps to keep them healthy.</li><br>
                <li><span class="semi-bold">O</span>rganic meat and milk can be <span class="semi-bold">richer in certain nutrients</span>. Results of a 2016 European study show that levels of
                    certain
                    nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher in organic meat and milk than in
                    conventionally
                    raised versions.</li><br>
                <li><span class="semi-bold">O</span>rganic food is <span class="semi-bold">GMO-free</span>. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or genetically engineered (GE) foods are plants
                    whose
                    DNA has been altered in ways that cannot occur in nature or in traditional crossbreeding, most commonly in order to
                    be
                    resistant to pesticides or produce an insecticide.</li><br>

            <h1 class="head">How to find organic products:</h1>
            <p><span class="bold">Many</span> of us have doubts regarding the authenticity of the available organic foods because of the fact that, simply by
            looking at the packaging and label, we are not able to distinguish between a genuine and a fake organic product. A basic
            and easy way to get genuine organic food is by following the below 3 ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold" style="padding-left: unset;">Food Logos(Organic):</span> these are indian certified organic logos</li>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="../images/bg-8.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="../images/bg-9.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <li><span class="bold" style="padding-left: unset;">Centers:</span>
                    <p>
                        <span class="semi-bold">Although</span> it is very hard to test the authenticity of the organic food at the base or consumer level, the same can be
                        tested at testing centers or laboratories. You can send a sample of the product to the concerned laboratories. One thing
                        to mind is that sometimes you might have to incur huge expenses for testing a single sample of organic product that you
                        might be doubtful about.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold" style="padding-left: unset;">Directly from farmers:</span>
                    <p>
                        <span class="semi-bold">Currently,</span> many of the farmers have started to produce organic fruits, vegetables, cereals and pulses in their farming
                        fields. If you can build a direct supply chain from those farmers, then there are minimal changes of adulteration in the
                        process. Such type of organic production i.e. directly by the farmers can cost less compared to a completely established
                        and certified organic grower. Furthermore, there are several Farmer Producer Organisations, where farmers can sell their
                        organic products straight to some of their regular customers at certain points and locations.
