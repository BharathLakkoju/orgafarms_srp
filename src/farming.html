            <p>
                <span class="bold">Organic</span> farming also known as ecological farming or biological farming, is an agricultural system that
                uses fertilizers of organic origin such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques
                such as crop rotation and companion planting. It originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing
                farming practices. Certified organic agriculture accounts for <span class="semi-bold">70 million hectares</span> (170 million acres) globally, with
                over half of that total in Australia.[6] Organic farming continues to be developed by various organizations today.
                Biological pest control, mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. Organic standards are
                designed to allow the use of naturally-occurring substances while <span class="semi-bold"> prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic
                substances.</span> For instance, naturally-occurring pesticides such as pyrethrin are permitted, while synthetic fertilizers
                and pesticides are generally prohibited. <span class="semi-bold">Synthetic substances</span> that are allowed include, for example, copper sulfate,
                elemental sulfur and Ivermectin. Genetically modified organisms, nano materials, human sewage sludge, plant growth
                regulators, hormones, and antibiotic use in livestock husbandry are prohibited. Organic farming advocates claim
                advantages in sustainability, openness, self-sufficiency, autonomy and independence, health, food security,
                and food safety.

                <h1>Approaches for Farming of Organic Cotton</h1>
                <p><span class="bold">Since</span> organic cotton production warrants the cultivation in the absence of agro-chemicals, it involves a careful
                    selection of components of farming system keeping the local resources, agro-climatic features and socio-economic
                    structure for the formation of a suitable package as follows:
                </p>
                <h3>Selection of site</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">Fields</span> with high degree of soil erosion and heavily infested with perennial weeds should not be put under organic
                    farming. Organic farming is not a farming by neglect or arm-chair cultivation and so, fertility levels of less
                    fertile
                    soils should be improved through organic means before opting for this type of cultivation.
                </p>
                <h3>Varietal selection</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">High</span> yielding varieties, which respond well to chemical inputs, may not always be suitable for organic farming.
                    Instead,
                    varieties which are hardy and capable of giving acceptable farming especially in the early phase of conversion
                    are
                    ideal. Varieties, which are jassid-tolerant, can be preferred over susceptible ones. Early maturing varieties
                    are less
                    exhaustive and will also help the crop to escape heavy bollworm damage.
                </p>
                <h3>Seed rate and sowing</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">About</span> 25 kg/ha of seeds at 75x15 cm spacing ensures a final plant population of 85-90 thousand plants/ha. One row
                    of
                    fodder cowpea should be drilled between two rows of cotton. This crop could be ploughed down and buried in soil
                    just
                    before its flowering.
                </p>
                <h3>Manuring</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">To</span> realise economical production, soil fertility has to be maintained and gradually improved. Improvement and
                    maintenance of organic matter of the soil is important in organic cotton production, as this would increase
                    physical
                    parameters of soil, improve soil structure and enhance nutrient supply.
                <ul>
                    <li>Farm yard manuring (FYM)</li>
                    <li>Fodder cowpea</li>
                    <li>Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata)</li>
                    <li>Vermicompost</li>
                    <li>Biofertilisers</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Weed Management</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">Fields</span> not infested with perennial weeds such as Cyperus sp. (Motha), Cyanodon dactylon (Doob) and Sachharum sp.
                    (Kans)
                    are preferred for organic farming as these are difficult to control. However, if such weeds occur in patches,
                    their
                    underground propagatory structures (stolons, rhizomes etc.) must be exposed by summer cultivation and manually
                    removed.
                    Growing a crop of cowpea between 2 rows of cotton will also suppress the early emerging weeds.
                </p>
                <h3>Selection of rotations</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">Crop</span> rotations play a very important role in restoring soil fertility and minimizing damage due to insect pests
                    and
                    weeds. High nutrient-exhaustive rotations must be avoided and instead rotations with a legume that is
                    recommended for
                    the locality may be adopted.
                </p>
                <h3>IPM strategies for crop protection:</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">The</span> crop protection to reduce the damage due to insect pests to organically cultivated cotton revolves around the
                    use of
                    bioagents such as predators such as Chrysoperla sp. or Apertochrysa spp., egg parasitoids such as Trichogramma,
                    larval
                    parasitoids such as Habrobracon spp. or insect pathogens such as Helicoverpa armigera Nuclear Polyhydrosis Virus
                    [NPV]
                    and a bacterium, Bacillus thuringuiensis var. kurstaki(B.t.k.) formulations along with utilisation of bird
                    perches and
                    botanical insecticides like neem products.
                </p>

                <h3>Ideal Conditions for organic Banana Cultivation</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">Banana</span> crop is a tropical fruit that can grow in alluvial soil and volcanic soil. Since India has a tropical
                    climate
                    most of the year, it can grow almost all year round.
                </p>
                <h3>Climate for Banana Cultivation</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">Banana</span> grows at an altitude of 1200 meters from sea level in a warm and humid climate. 20⁰C- 35⁰C is the most
                    favorable
                    temperature range along with a high level of humidity for banana farming in India. The growth gets retarded
                    below 20⁰C
                    and above 35⁰C. They take longer time to mature in cooler climates while the growth and yield is reduced at
                    lower
                    humidity and temperature. An average annual rainfall of 1700 mm distributed evenly throughout the year favours
                    good
                    growth and satisfactory yield.
                </p>
                <h3>Land preparation</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">The</span> land is prepared by ploughing twice and harrowing thrice. Levelling is done by tractor after Harrowing.
                    Ridges and
                    furrows are made and the pits ( 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm) are dug and Filled up with well decomposed FYM/compost.
                    The pits
                    are irrigated to allow the soil to settle.

                <h3>Planting and infilling</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">The</span> time of planting of banana depends solely on climatic conditions and availability of water. In Areas of heavy
                    and
                    continuous rains, planting of banana should be done after rains i.e. September -October and in those areas where
                    rains
                    are not so heavy planting can be done in June-July. In Irrigated areas the planting is done in February – March
                    and in
                    hilly areas in April. The planting Material is treated with a solution of 250 g of ghee, 0.500 g of honey and 15
                    kg of
                    cow dung. The Spacing adopted by organic banana cultivators in Maharashtra are 1.5 m x 1.5 m and 1.5 m x 1.8 m.
                    However
                    for tissue cultured banana, a spacing of 1.5 m x 1.8 m accomodating a plant population of 4400 plants/ha is
                    considered
                    for working out the cost of this model scheme.
                </p>
                <h3>Intercropping</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">Onion</span>, soyabean and cowpea can be grown as intercrop in Banana by planting on raised bedWhich will give
                    additional
                    income. Growing intercrops like cowpea and soyabean also helps in Suppressing weed growth. In preparation of
                    model
                    scheme, the income and expenditure for Intercropping is not considered.
                </p>
                <h3>Manuring</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">15</span> t of FYM/compost is applied at the time of land preparation. After plantation, the manuring is Done by
                    applying 5 kg
                    FYM, 2 Kg Bhumilab, 20 g trichoderma and 30-50 ml humus per plant in First year and FYM @ 10 kg, Bhumilab @ 2.5
                    – 3 kg
                    per plant during subsequent two years. The Spraying of Gomutra (Cow urine) and Jeevamrut is also taken up. The
                    Jeevamrut
                    is prepared by Adding 10 kg cow dung, 5 l of cow urine, 2 kg black jaggery, 2 kg ground pulses powder, handful
                    Of bund
                    soil in 200 l of water, the solution is kept for 2 to 7 days in shade for fermentation. During the fermentation,
                    the
                    solution is stirred on daily. Biofertilizers like Azatobacter(20 g/plant), Phosphate Solubilizing bacteria (PSB)
                    (20
                    g/plant) and EM solution at the rate of 1 l per acre. The EM (Effective Microorganisms) solution is prepared by
                    adding 1
                    l EM, 2 kg black jaggery, 50 g salt mixed in a drum of suitable size.
                </p>
                <h3>Irrigation</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">The</span> plants need to be irrigated immediately after planting. About 30-40 weekly irrigations are Required. When
                    summer
                    temperature crosses 37.5 0C, irrigation on every 3rd day is essential.
                </p>
                <h3>Plant Protection</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">The</span> major pests and diseases observed in banana crop are rhizome weevil, nematodes, bunchy Top, leaf spot, etc.
                    In the
                    case of organic farming, dasparni arka and neem cake are used to Control pests and diseases. The dasparni arka,
                    which
                    means mixture of leaves of ten kinds of Plants (das=ten, parna=leaf, arka=concentrated form of solution) is
                    prepared by
                    adding 25 kg
                </p>
                <h3>Harvesting</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">The</span> crop gets ready for harvest after 11-12 months of planting. First ratoon crop is ready after 8-10 months from
                    harvesting the main crop and second ratoon after 8 months of harvesting of The first ratoon crop. Thus over the
                    period
                    of 27-30 months, it is possible to harvest three Crops i.e. one main crop and two ratoon crops.

                <p><span class="bold">Organic</span> maize can be marketed on a farmer to famer basis. Organic maize prices can range from 1.5-2 times the
                    price of
                    conventional maize. Organic maize gets a bit harder to manage as you move to larger acreages and it makes more
                    difficult
                    to deal with rotation, fertility and weed control issues.
